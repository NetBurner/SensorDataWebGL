# Visualizing Sensor Data with WebGL and WebSockets
This example shows how you can utilize WebGL with Three.js to visualize real-time sensor data from your NetBurner device over a WebSocket connection.
<br><br>
The code and steps required for setup detailed in the article, [Visualizing Sensor Data with WebGL and WebSockets](https://www.netburner.com/learn/visualizing-sensor-data-with-webgl-and-websockets/),
which is presented on NetBurner's site at www.netburner.com.
